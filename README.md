# MIS-543-Project-3

In this folder you'll find the Blockchian.py. 

Quick! What do I have to write?
===============================
Blockchian.py is the file in which you will add blocks and verify the integrity of the blockchain. 
Blockchian.py provides all the scaffolding you need to handle the command line arguments we 
will use in the grading of your project.

A break down the code and its classes and methods:

Block class:
===============================

This class represents a block in the blockchain.

__init__(self, data, previous_hash): The constructor takes in data (any information which is to be recorded in the block) and previous_hash (the hash of the previous block in the chain). It sets the block's timestamp to the current datetime, saves the provided data, saves the previous hash, and calculates the block's own hash using the calculate_hash method.

calculate_hash(self): This method concatenates the block's timestamp, data, and previous hash into a string. It then uses the SHA-256 hash function from the hashlib library to generate a hexadecimal digest of this string, which serves as the block's unique identifier.

Blockchain class:
===============================

This class represents the blockchain itself, a linked list of Block objects.

__init__(self): The constructor initializes the blockchain with a list containing a genesis block, which is the first block in the blockchain, created by the create_genesis_block method.

create_genesis_block(self): This method creates the first block in the blockchain with the data "Genesis Block" and a previous hash of "0".

get_latest_block(self): This method returns the most recently added block in the blockchain.

add_block(self, new_block): This method takes a newly created block, sets its previous hash to the hash of the latest block in the chain, recalculates its hash (since the previous hash has changed), and appends it to the chain.

is_chain_valid(self): This method checks the integrity of the blockchain. It iterates through each block and ensures that:

The current block's hash is correct (it matches the hash generated by calculate_hash).
The current block's previous_hash matches the actual hash of the previous block.

If any of these conditions fail, the blockchain is invalid, which could indicate that the data has been tampered with.
